## üî¨ The Science Behind It

The calculator uses several scientific principles:

### Biomechanics
- **Deck Width**: Based on shoe size and foot biomechanics research
- **Stance Width**: Calculated from height for natural positioning
- **Center of Gravity**: Optimized for balance and control

### Physics & Geometry
- **Moment of Inertia**: Wheelbase affects rotational stability
- **Rolling Resistance**: Wheel size and hardness optimization
- **Load Distribution**: Weight-based truck recommendations
- **Contact Patch Physics**: Grip vs speed calculations

### Component Specifications

#### Deck
- Width: 7.5" - 9.0" (based on shoe size biomechanics)
- Length: Calculated from height ratios
- Wheelbase: Stability vs maneuverability balance

#### Trucks
- Width: Matched to deck for optimal performance
- Height: Based on wheel clearance needs
- Tightness: Weight and preference-based recommendations

#### Wheels
- Diameter: 50mm - 75mm (style and terrain optimized)
- Hardness: 78A - 101A (grip vs speed balance)
- Contact Patch: Calculated for optimal performance

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **HTML5**: Semantic, accessible markup
- **CSS3**: Modern responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure ES6+ code
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Works without JavaScript for basic functionality

### Deployment
The app automatically deploys to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions when changes are pushed to the main branch.
